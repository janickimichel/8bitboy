Karsten Obarski invented 1987 the MOD format for his Ultimate Tracker running on Amiga computers.
Since then, countless songs are created, especially for the demoscene.

[8bitboy](http://8bitboy.popforge.de/) is an Amiga ModPlayer which acts as a Worker. This makes the player very stable, capable of playing mod-files without any gaps on lowest latency. Perfect for games!

The initial playback routine has been written in 2006 available at http://popforge.googlecode.com. However I refactored huge parts to make it more readable and extendable.
